# Nostalgic Calculator

This is my first real attempt at object oriented programming: An HTML calculator modeled after my memory of calculators from public school days.
Besides standard operations, the calculator has some advanced functionality including order of operations, missing operator and operand fallbacks, and input memory. I also had some fun with CSS styling.
